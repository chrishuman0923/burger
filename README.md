# burger

My burger application is an application that demonstrates the functionality and flexibility of a full-stack application that combines a database, a server and client-side DOM manipulation. The front-end is made up of an html file that was generated by the handlebars template engine. The data in the DOM is dynamically generated from data stored in a mySQL database. The back-end files handle all of the url routing and returning of JSON data to the front-end using Express.js. The app is deployed on Heroku [here](https://nameless-temple-88687.herokuapp.com/).
